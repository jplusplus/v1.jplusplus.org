Journalism++ was created in 2011 by [@nicolaskb](http://twitter.com/nicolaskb/) and [@pirhoo](http://twitter.com/pirhoo/). We started working together back in 2010 at OWNI, a Paris-based news media where we set up and managed the datajournalism team.

We founded Journalism++ to accompany newsrooms in their transitions towards the web of data. With our clients, we do training sessions, consulting missions and build innovative HTML5 applications.

From data collection to analysis to publishing, our expertise is known worldwide. We are building [Feowl](http://www.feowl.com/comingsoon/), a new kind of crowdsourcing platform. We take part in [Datawrapper](http://datawrapper.de/), a super-easy tool for data visualization. And with [E-Diplomacy](http://ediplomacy.afp.com/), we manage to make sense out of millions of tweets.

Journalism++ is based in Paris (rue Richer, near Metro 9 station Grands Boulevards) and in Berlin (Betahaus, U8 Moritzplatz).

Since August 2012, Journalism++ is very happy to work with the best project manager this side of the Atlantic, [@annelisebouyer](https://twitter.com/annelisebouyer)!
