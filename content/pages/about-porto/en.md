## About

Journalism++ Porto was launched in March 2014 with the mission to create tools for data based storytelling. 

The founding team is [@aiscarvalho](http://twitter.com/aiscarvalho), [@rlaf](http://twitter.com/rlaf) and [@saritamoreira](http://twitter.com/saritamoreira), who have been pushing the open data scene in Portugal forward. Together they started, in 2010, [Transparência Hackday Portugal](http://transparenciahackday.org), a collective that gathers monthly to develop projects around data, citizenship and public information.

Over the years, this trio has been cultivating skills that range from design to data hacking, coding and copywriting. Among others, they have worked in India, Mozambique, East Timor and Belgium, having collaborated with institutions such as Global Voices, Medialab Prado, Regards Citoyens or @Verdade Newspaper.
