Creative Commons approached us to develop a set of infographics around the theme of Open Educational Resources (OER) in the European Union.


Having compiled a comparative analysis of copyright exemptions and restrictions in the 28 countries, Creative Commons was looking for a way to transform the raw legal data into a readable and understandable form. 


Upon  receiving their dataset — a series of spreadsheets with long tables —  we analysed it, devised a narrative and aesthetic flow to appropriately  frame the issue, and executed the final graphic work.


In the process of parsing the information we tried to highlight the most  relevant  aspects of this study: the differences in legislation in the EU  countries, the limitations faced by teachers when compiling resources  and  presenting work either in the classroom or on online teaching platforms, contradictory laws and the absurdity of some situations.


The resulting infographics will be available at the OER website. The  purpose is to promote discussion over this issue and raise awareness  towards the impact of the current copyright laws in education.
